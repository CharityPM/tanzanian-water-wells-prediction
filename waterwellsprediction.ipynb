    "### **Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tanzania faces significant challenges in providing consistent access to clean water for its citizens. With an estimated population of 70.5 million in mid‑2025, Tanzania remains one of Africa’s fastest-growing nations in terms of population and resource demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business problem**\n",
    "#### The client seeks insights into patterns distinguishing **functional** versus **non-functional or repair-needed wells**, to inform drilling strategies and maintenance priorities. The goal is to help villages avoid prolonged downtime and reduce socio-economic burdens—especially on women and children, who are often tasked with collecting water.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project objective**\n",
    "#### Use the Pump It Up dataset (featuring features like pump type, installation year, payment method, and location) to build a **classification model** that:\n",
    "#### - Predict well status in a **binary setup**: functional vs. needs attention (repair or non-functional).  \n",
    "#### -  Identify the key features driving pump failures (e.g., pump type, installation year, management system).\n",
    "\n",
    "### *** Project goal/value**\n",
    "#### Enables targeted maintenance, directing resources to at-risk wells before they fail.#### Reduces the socioeconomic burden of water insecurity by ensuring greaterhealth, education, and gender equity outcomes.\n",
